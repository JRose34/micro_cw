# my_sdr
This will be an SDR for transmitting ameteur signals via  microcontrollor such as Raspberry Pi Pico or another version.

Essentially, the final product will be something where I can choose which band I want to transmit on based on my license level.

From there, I should then be able to easily find a band plan and check the preferred modes.  Band plans and privileges are sourced from arrl.org.

The first version of this will focus on CW--I'll likely be looking at/borrowing code from other sources that have worked closer with the Pico; if not, I can at least write up something that will use the GPIO to connect to other hardware and generate waves that way. 

Eventually I'd like to at least generate SSB and AM; there are a lot of FM stuff out there already in the VHF/UHF side of things, but these are not often used for long distance contacts (especially for techs).
